# 🗓️ CloudShelf Multi-Role Implementation Timeline (Part-Time)

> **Realistic schedule for demonstrating AWS Solutions Architect, DevOps Engineer, and Developer roles — part-time (Sun/Mon/Tues, 2–3 hrs/session)**

This timeline is designed for a part-time pace, assuming you can dedicate 2–3 hours per session on Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday. The project is structured to cover all three AWS roles, with validation checkpoints and progress tracking, and is expected to take about 10–11 weeks (flexible, adjust as needed).

---

## 📋 **Project Overview**

```yaml
Estimated Duration: 10–11 weeks (part-time, 3 sessions/week × 2–3 hrs)
Sessions: Sunday, Monday, Tuesday (2–3 hrs each)
Approach: Sequential with validation checkpoints
Roles: Solutions Architect → DevOps Engineer → Developer
Goal: Portfolio demonstrating all three AWS specializations
Current Date: September 7, 2025
Start Date: September 7, 2025 (Sunday)
End Date: ~Mid-November 2025 (flexible)
```
