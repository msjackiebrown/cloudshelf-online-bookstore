|------------|-------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **Purpose** | WHY we're building this system | WHAT the system needs to do |
| **Audience** | Business stakeholders, executives, investors | Development team, architects, testers |
| **Focus** | Business goals, market opportunity, ROI | Technical functionality, system behavior |
| **Language** | Business language, metrics, objectives | Technical language, specifications |
| **Timeline** | Created before development starts | Created after BRD, before detailed design |
| **Owner** | Product Manager, Business Analyst | Systems Analyst, Solutions Architect |

### **Software Requirements Specification (SRS)**

**What it Contains:**
```markdown
‚úÖ Functional Requirements:
   - FR-1: System shall allow user registration
   - FR-2: System shall allow book catalog browsing
   - FR-3: System shall support shopping cart functionality
   - FR-4: System shall process secure payments

‚úÖ Non-Functional Requirements:
   - NFR-1: 99.9% uptime availability
   - NFR-2: Support 10,000 concurrent users
   - NFR-3: < 2 second response times
   - NFR-4: GDPR compliance for data handling

‚úÖ Technical Specifications:
   - System interfaces and APIs
   - Data formats and structures
   - Security requirements
   - Performance benchmarks
```

**SRS Language Example:**
> "FR-2: The system shall allow users to browse and search the book catalog. NFR-4: The system shall respond to user actions within 2 seconds."

    end
```

### **How They Work Together:**

1. **BRD Drives SRS**: Business requirements inform technical requirements
2. **SRS Translates BRD**: Converts business needs into technical specifications
3. **Both Inform Architecture**: Solutions architects use both to design systems

**Example Connection:**
- **BRD States**: "Must handle Black Friday traffic spikes (10x normal load) while maintaining < 2 second page loads"
- **SRS Translates**: "NFR-2: System shall support 50,000 concurrent users with 95th percentile response time < 2 seconds"
- **Architecture Responds**: Design auto-scaling Lambda functions with CloudFront CDN

   - Functional Requirements: FR-1, FR-2, etc.
   - Non-Functional Requirements: NFR-1, NFR-2, etc.
   - Clear acceptance criteria for each requirement

3. **Include Technical Details**
   - Interface specifications
   - Data format requirements
   - Security and compliance needs
   - Performance benchmarks

## üéØ Key Takeaway

**BRD** = Business case for building the system (WHY and WHAT business value)
**SRS** = Technical specification of system behavior (WHAT the system does and HOW well)

Both are essential:
- **BRD** justifies the project and guides business decisions
- **SRS** guides development and testing efforts
- **Together** they ensure technical solutions deliver business value

Your CloudShelf project now has both documents working together effectively!
