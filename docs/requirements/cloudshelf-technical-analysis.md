## Architecture Overview

### Tutorial Architecture Pattern

**Architecture Approach**: Serverless-first with security isolation

**Current Tutorial Implementation:**

- ‚úÖ **VPC Network Foundation** - Security isolation and network setup
- ‚úÖ **IAM Security** - Roles, policies, and access control
- ‚úÖ **Book Catalog API** - Browse and search books (RDS PostgreSQL)
- ‚úÖ **Shopping Cart API** - Add/remove items, session persistence (DynamoDB)
- ‚úÖ **API Gateway** - REST API management and routing
- üîÑ **Static Website** - Frontend hosting (S3 + CloudFront)
- ‚è≥ **Enhanced Features**: User authentication, order processing

**Tutorial Traffic Flow:**

```
Internet ‚Üí CloudFront CDN ‚Üí S3 (Static Website) + API Gateway (APIs) ‚Üí Lambda Functions ‚Üí VPC ‚Üí RDS/DynamoDB
```

**Core AWS Services Demonstrated:**

- **Global Delivery**: CloudFront CDN for edge caching and performance
- **Static Hosting**: S3 bucket for HTML/CSS/JavaScript frontend
- **API Management**: API Gateway with throttling and monitoring
- **Serverless Compute**: Java Lambda functions in VPC private subnets
- **Data Storage**: RDS PostgreSQL (Book Catalog) + DynamoDB (Shopping Cart)
- **Security**: VPC isolation, IAM roles, encryption at rest and transit

## Key Architecture Decisions

### Tutorial Learning Focus

| **Business Requirement**   | **Technical Solution**     | **AWS Implementation**              | **Learning Objective**           |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| "Fast, responsive website" | Edge content delivery      | CloudFront CDN with edge caching    | Global performance optimization  |
| "Reliable shopping cart"   | Auto-scaling NoSQL storage | DynamoDB with auto-scaling          | NoSQL design patterns            |
| "Scalable architecture"    | Serverless compute         | AWS Lambda with automatic scaling   | Serverless architecture benefits |
| "Cost-effective cloud"     | Pay-per-use pricing        | Serverless services, no fixed costs | Cost optimization strategies     |
| "Secure data storage"      | Security by design         | VPC isolation, IAM, encryption      | AWS security best practices      |

### Key Technical Decisions for Tutorial

**Decision 1: Serverless-First Architecture**

- **Choice**: AWS Lambda for all compute workloads
- **Rationale**: Demonstrates auto-scaling, pay-per-request, zero server management
- **Learning**: Serverless benefits and cold start considerations

**Decision 2: Hybrid Data Strategy**

- **Choice**: RDS PostgreSQL + DynamoDB combination
- **Rationale**: Shows SQL vs NoSQL use cases, transaction vs speed optimization
- **Learning**: Data storage patterns and when to use each service

**Decision 3: Security-First Network Design**

- **Choice**: VPC foundation before application resources
- **Rationale**: Demonstrates security isolation and defense-in-depth
- **Learning**: AWS network security and VPC best practices
