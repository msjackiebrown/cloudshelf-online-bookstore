### 1.5 Business Requirements Traceability

This SRS translates business requirements from the CloudShelf BRD into technical specifications:

| **Business Requirement** | **Technical Requirements** | **Rationale** |
|---------------------------|----------------------------|---------------|
| 2% market share by Year 3 | NFR-5, NFR-6, NFR-7 (scalability) | System must scale with business growth |
| <2 second page load target | NFR-1, NFR-2, NFR-3 (performance) | Performance directly impacts conversion |
| Infrastructure cost <0.5% revenue | NFR-17, NFR-18, NFR-19 (cost optimization) | Financial sustainability requirement |
| 99.9% uptime requirement | NFR-9, NFR-10, NFR-11 (availability) | Business continuity and customer trust |
| Regulatory compliance | NFR-12, NFR-14, NFR-15 (security) | Legal and compliance obligations |

### 1.5 Architectural Context

Cloudshelf Online Bookstore is designed as a cloud-native, multi-tier web application leveraging AWS managed services. The architecture includes:

- Presentation layer (web UI)
- API layer (RESTful APIs via API Gateway and Lambda)
- Data layer (RDS for relational data, DynamoDB for NoSQL, S3 for object storage)
- Security and monitoring (IAM, Security Groups, CloudWatch)

For detailed architecture diagrams, component descriptions, and deployment patterns, see the [Cloudshelf Architecture Guide](../cloudshelf-online-bookstore-architecture-guide.md).
