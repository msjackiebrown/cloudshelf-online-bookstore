```
ðŸ“š Starting my AWS Solutions Architect certification journey!

While building CloudShelf, I realized this is the perfect time to formalize my AWS knowledge with the SAA-C03 certification.

My approach:
âœ… Learn by doing - implement concepts in real project
âœ… Document everything - create study notes as architecture docs
âœ… Share insights - teach others while learning
âœ… Apply immediately - use CloudShelf as validation lab

Study plan: 12 weeks to certification
Project integration: CloudShelf as learning laboratory
Content creation: Share journey and insights
